# Hello-You-BO

Hello you

Dit is mijn eerste beroepsopdracht op het Mediacollege Amsterdam. De opdracht is dat we een tekstsbased adventure gaan maken in JS voor met als doelgroep mijn mede studenten van het Mediacollege Amsterdam.
Dit is een keuzeverhaal met minimaal 22 stukjes (verhaalstukje, keuzevraag en keuze invoer van de gebruiker) en 4 verschillende einden (verhaal stukje). 
We gebruiken voor afbeeldingen ASCII code.
De Js code gaat op githb staan (ook tijdens de ontwikkeling).
De tekstbased adventure is via NodeJS te spelen.

Idee: Een haunted house waar het eerst lijkt of er geesten zijn, maar je er later achter komt dat er een satanistische sekte in verborgen is die demonen oproepen.

Start: You’re walking through your street. You notice that the missing person posters of Katie who have been missing since last summer still hang there. The sun is setting and you have to hurry home because mom made chicken, and you love chicken. But as you’re hurrying home you notice the old abandoned house where there are ridiculous stories about it being haunted. You are curious if the stories may be true or are just some ridiculous stories that the weird kid Kevin keeps telling about.

vraag1: Do you want to go to take a peek inside the house to prove Kevin wrong or do you want to go home and eat the delicious chicken your mom made?

antwoord1a: It wouldn’t hurt to take a peek. What’s the worst thing that could happen? Me getting kidnapped by a stranger who will do horrible things to me until I beg God to kill me? I’ll take the risk.(stuk2)

antwoord1b: I don’t think that’s a great idea. What if Katie did look in there and is missing because of that? Plus mom is making chicken and I really haven’t eaten all day. So I’ll continue going home. (einde1)

stuk2:  You decide it wouldn’t hurt to just peek around the house to see if there are any ghosts or creepy old men. So you walk over to the abandoned house. You peek through the window and notice that it’s all black in there. All you can see are some furniture underneath a white blanket. How long has this house been abandoned for? You then go to the door and see if it’s locked. You then open the door and a sudden chill washes over you.

vraag2: Are you sure you want to go in the house?

antwoord2a: No, I want to go back to mommy and her delicious chicken! (einde1)

antwoord2b: Yes, I’m a big boy! Mom and her chicken can wait! (stuk3)

stuk3: You then walk inside the abandoned house. The door suddenly closes on itself and you try to open it. It’s locked. That’s what happens if a house isn’t maintained frequently. You then suddenly hear a creaking of the stairs, but you can’t see where the stairs are. You need some source of light.

vraag3: What will you do?

antwoord3a: I will go look on the ground to see if there is a flashlight conveniently laying around somewhere. (stuk4)

antwoord3b: I will feel the wall to see if there is a light switch so I can turn on the light. (stuk7)

stuk4: You go look at the floor to find something useful. You can’t see anything so you go on your knees to crouch to find anything. You crawl by the covered furniture and find yourself hitting your head against a door.

vraag4: Will you open the door?

antwoord4a: No, the door is smelly. (stuk7)

antwoord4b: Yes, maybe there is something useful in there. (Stuk5)

stuk5: You decide to open the door. Even though it’s really dark, you can see that it apparently is a closet. In the closet you see Something you think is a flashlight. You grab it, but notice it is molted onto some other device. When you turn on the flashlight and point it into the closet. You then see that the flashlight is attached to a 
vacuum cleaner and that vacuum cleaner is attached to a green plumber suit with a big L on the hat.

vraag5: Will you put on the ridiculous plumber suit with the vacuum attached to it to finally see in the house?

antwoord5a: Yes, I need to find the key to open the main door and go back home because mom made chicken! (stuk10)

antwoord5b: No, I don’t want to look ridiculous while roaming this scary house. (stuk6)

stuk6: You decide that it isn’t worth it to look ridiculous while searching for the key so you continue looking while you can’t see anything. (stuk7)

stuk7: You struggle your way through the darkness and find yourself at the bottom of some stairs. You hear a weird sound coming from upstairs. 

vraag7: Will you go upstairs to investigate the sound?

antwoord7a: No, I can’t see anything and might break my neck while trying to go upstairs. (stuk8)

antwoord7b: Yes, maybe it was the key falling somehow upstairs. (stuk9)

stuk8: You decide it wouldn’t be wise to go upstairs. You turn around and see a key conveniently laying on a table in front of the stairs. You try the key on the front door and unlock it. You now can finally go outside. (einde1)

stuk9: You decide to go upstairs. When you struggle to climb the stairs you suddenly see a ghost appear in front of you. Before you can do anything it already possesses you. (einde3)

stuk10: You put on the green plumber suit that has the vacuum cleaner and flashlight attached to it. You now can finally look around. You hear a sound coming from upstairs. 

vraag10: Will you go investigate the sound or will you continue searching downstairs before going upstairs?

antwoord10a: I will go investigate the sound. Maybe it was the key somehow falling. (stuk11)

antwoord10b: I will continue searching downstairs before going upstairs. (stuk12)

stuk11: You go upstairs and see a ghost appear in front of you. All you can think about is using the vacuum to hopefully suck the ghost. (ghost boss fight)

stuk12: You decide that you will look a bit longer around downstairs. While looking you notice a bookcase. You take a closer look and notice it isn’t a bookcase, but a movie case with a lot of movies in it. You then notice your favorite movie called Backdoor Openers 9.

vraag12: Will you take Backdoor Openers 9 back home with you to watch with your mother for movie night or not?

antwoord12a: No, mom and I have watched that movie way too much. I actually should continue searching for the key. (stuk13)

antwoord12b: Yes, mom would love to watch it again with me. I better take it home with me. (stuk14)

stuk13: You decided that you and mom have watched Backdoor Openers 9 way too much and that your mom probably already picked another movie for tonight. You then realize you can’t find any keys downstairs and decide to go upstairs. (stuk11)

stuk14: You decide that mom would love to watch Backdoor Openers 9 together with you again and you decide to grab it. when you try to grab it you notice it’s stuck and when you pull harder you see that the movie case suddenly moves sideways revealing a secret staircase leading down. Out of curiosity you walk down the secret stairs and you find yourself in a dark dungeon looking place. While looking a bit around you notice a dark hooded figure. You can hear him whispering some language you can’t understand. When you walk slowly closer the hooded figure notices you and summons a big demon looking beast. (demon boss fight)

It is the weird kid, Kevin! Out of anger you punch Kevin, steal his keys and walk back out of the house. The next day you notice how the house isn’t there anymore and no one seems to remember it too. Kevin also seems to be gone, but you don’t mind. You never liked Kevin anyway. End 4: Mystery solved, It’s fucking Kevin
